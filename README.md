# Digital Forensics Case Study

A hands-on digital forensics investigation project where I acquired a forensic image, analyzed artifacts using Autopsy, recovered deleted files, and generated an investigation report following standard forensic methodology.

# Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| FTK Imager | Evidence acquisition & drive imaging |
| Autopsy | Evidence analysis & artifact recovery |
| Windows/Linux VM | Analysis environment |

# Objectives
- Acquire a forensic disk image without altering evidence
- Analyze data for artifacts, deleted files, and metadata
- Recover evidence and document findings
- Create a formal digital forensics report

---

# Investigation Process

# Evidence Acquisition
- Created a forensic disk image using  FTK Imager
- Ensured integrity using MD5 hash values 

# Evidence Analysis
- Loaded image into Autopsy
- Examined file structure, browser history, bookmarks, and logs
- Located deleted/hidden files and recovered artifacts

# Reporting
- Documented findings + screenshots
- Summarized possible incident scenario
- Wrote final forensic report

# Key Findings
Example (edit once completed):

- Recovered deleted `.jpg` photos from disk
- Identified suspicious file metadata
- Logged timestamps and user activity traces

---

# Skills Demonstrated
- Chain-of-custody documentation
- Disk imaging + evidence preservation
- Data recovery & file carving
- Report writing for legal review
- Attention to detail & analysis mindset

---

# What I Learned
- How forensic tools evaluate and recover artifacts
- Importance of evidence integrity & documentation
- Practical investigation workflow used in real cases

---

# Future Improvements
- Automate hashing using Python script
- Expand into network traffic forensic analysis
- Create second scenario with incident narrative
